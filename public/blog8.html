            Stripes bring a sense of summer, becoming all-time favorites owing to the numerous ways you can wear them. 
            Stripes are a wardrobe staple for every woman, regardless of whether her style is feminine, classic, 
            eclectic, minimal, or a mix of these.<br><br>

            Whether you're looking to replenish your wardrobe with wear-anywhere basics, add a few nuanced knits and 
            dresses to your outfit rotation, or want a few fresh end-of-summer styles to transition into your fall 
            wardrobe, keep reading for a guide to wearing striped outfits.

        <h2>Types of Stripes</h2> <br>
        <p>
            Vertical Stripes<br><br>
            Vertical stripes, known to have a slimming effect, can be found in various clothing items, including vertical 
            striped dresses, pants, tops, and more. What is the best way to wear vertical stripes? It's simple: wear them 
            in a print-on-print look as you style the vertical stripes from head to toe, or pair them with solid bottoms 
            to keep the focus on the design feature of the striped essentials.<br><br>

        </p> <br>
        
        <h2>Horizontal Stripes</h2> <br>
        <p>
            Horizontal stripes are among the most popular and widely worn types of stripes, and they make a stylish 
            addition to any wardrobe. However, there is a persistent myth that horizontal stripes make you look wider, 
            but if styled correctly, these stripes are appealing and make for a great sartorial style.<br><br>
        </p> <br>

        <h2>Candy Stripes</h2> <br>
        <p>
            Nothing we can say about candy stripes can adequately describe these stripes' colorful, vibrant offerings. With 
            designers such as Laura Kim and Jason Wu incorporating candy stripes into their collections and street fashion 
            icons succumbing to the frenzy, there is little doubt that the trend left an impression and is still going 
            strong.<br><br>
        </p> <br>

        <h2>Hairline Stripes</h2> <br>
        <p>
            As the name implies, hairline stripes are the thinnest stripes, their diameter usually equaling the width of 
            a hair. Because a single hairline stripe would be hard to spot, the patterns surrounding these types of 
            stripes combine several of them to form a bolder variant of the stripes.<br><br>
        </p> <br>

        <h2>Roman Stripes</h2> <br>
        <p>
            This type of stripe is made up of brightly colored stripes in clashing colors that vary in thickness to 
            create the effect of multiple colors being used. These stylish stripes are mostly seen in home furnishings, 
            but they can also be found in various clothing pieces, such as a horizontal striped dress, a vertical striped 
            dress, or a striped shirt dress.<br><br>
        </p> <br>

        <h2>Chalk Stripes</h2> <br>
        <p>
            This stripe type is a distressed variation of the pinstripes, sleek and clear. The chalk stripe, which is 
            included in the formal stripes but is also widely used in informal clothing, has broken gaps that give the 
            stripe a fuzzy effect.
