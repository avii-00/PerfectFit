            Many claim that the world of fashion is a fickle creature. It's because if you follow fashion trends one 
            year, it can change and vary widely depending on what is happening in design houses and in pop culture. 
            Keeping up with everything that is trendy and what is not is sometimes annoying because fashion is 
            constantly changing. But it can endure the test of time when it comes to classic fashion. 
        </p> 

        <p>
            Despite the fashion industry's constant change, some trends seem to catch on and endure for a long time. 
            As a result, it's great to have these pieces in your wardrobe because you can wear them at any time, 
            regardless of the setting. You've come to the right place if you're looking to spend money on a wardrobe 
            that can withstand change or last for a long time. Here is a list of the fashion fads that never really 
            go out of style. 
        </p> <br><br>

        <h2>Trousers</h2> <br>
        <p>
            There are many different designs for pants and slacks. These can be worn in almost any style, from plaid 
            to solid black. They are sometimes worn by women with flats or heels. These pants can be dressed up or 
            down depending on the occasion or the look you're going for. Some people prefer to wear their pants around 
            the house, while others do slacks for professional outings. It's not surprising that these bottoms haven't 
            gone out of style because they are appropriate for any situation.
        </p> <br>
        
        <h2>The Simple White T-Shirt</h2> <br>
        <p>
            White-collar shirts were initially worn by men in the workplace and were connected to strength and 
            masculinity. They stood for wealth and social status in the 19th century, but as they became more widely 
            available and affordable, their symbolic meaning shifted. <br>
            They were gradually replaced by more contemporary versions as celebrities and women began donning them. 
            Since you can wear a white button-up shirt with anything, it can be a wardrobe staple. Wear the look however 
            you like—for work or a romantic evening—and you won't regret it.
        </p> <br>

        <h2>Collar Shirts</h2> <br>
        <p>
            The collared shirt is also from a bygone era, like the turtleneck. There are numerous ways to design collar 
            shirts. Some blouses are made with buttons, while others are simply made casually without them. Men wear 
            collared shirts more frequently than women do. However, because collar shirts are ideal for ties, brooches, 
            and necklaces, many people adore wearing them. The neighborhood retail store will always carry items that 
            are in style. 
        </p> <br>

        <h2>Skinny/Straight Leg Jeans</h2> <br>
        <p>
            Jeans, or “blue jeans” as they were originally called, have always been in style. The first pair was 
            developed in 1873 by Levi Strauss and Jacob Davis, and it was primarily worn by cowboys and miners. In the 
            1950s, all styles of jeans—including skinny, slim, flare, and boot cut—became very popular. However, due to 
            their tight fit, skinny and straight-leg jeans are the most common and are preferred by many people. Contrary
            to bell-bottom jeans, skinny jeans are ideal for highlighting your figure and your footwear.
        </p> <br>

        <h2>Pencil Skirt</h2> <br>
        <p>
            The first American woman to fly in the airplane, Mrs. Edith Berry, was responsible for the pencil skirt's 
            invention in 1908. She tied a length of rope around her ankles out of concern that her skirt would wiggle 
            and eventually become damaged during the flight. <br>

            She was immediately photographed because it was a historic occasion and because the “hobble skirt” trend was 
            started as a result. The first instance of the modern pencil skirt was in 1954's H-line collection by 
            Christian Dior. You will adore this item whether you prefer vintage or contemporary style because it is the 
            most feminine shape and emphasizes the hips and waist of women of all sizes.
        </p> <br>

        <h2>High Heels</h2> <br>
        <p>
            You might be surprised to learn that heels were first created for men at a time when we view stilettos and 
            platforms as an expression of female style and sexuality. They were worn by soldiers in Persia during the 
            fifteenth century to aid in keeping their feet in stirrups. After a while, immigrants from Persia arrived 
            in Europe and brought fashion with them. <br>

            Many male aristocrats wore heels to appear taller, but eventually, women took over the fashion. They quickly 
            gained favor with ladies of the upper class, particularly in Venice where the heel length reached 54 cm. 
            Today, we wear heels because they add style and elegance to any outfit. They are also a fantastic option if 
            you want to look slimmer. Wearing them with your favorite pair of jeans, skirt, or stunning dress is a style 
            that will never go out of style.
