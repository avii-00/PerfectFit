        <p>
            Shorts were once thought to be rather risqué or inappropriate attire for women. Not to mention that the 
            ladies fashionable (and quite daring) enough to wear it had to serve a penalty under the law. Thankfully, 
            times have changed.
        </p> 

        <p>
            Shorts are now a popular piece of clothing for both ladies and gentlemen. They line the racks of hundreds of 
            clothing stores all year out, with new styles appearing now and then.<br><br>

            Shorts are unquestionably a summer wardrobe staple for most people. The humble short is the ideal garment for 
            introducing a slightly carefree and casual touch to any outfit, whether you're at work, on break, or simply 
            going about daily life.
        </p> <br><br>

        <h2>Different Types of Shorts</h2> <br>
        <p>
            With many different types of shorts available, you may be perplexed about what to wear. This essential 
            women's shorts guide will have you feeling more confident for your next summer shopping trip.<br><br>
            
            Short Shorts<br><br>
            Short shorts are a timeless addition to any summer or spring wardrobe. Their length is usually above the 
            middle of the thigh. These shorts are typically made of denim, which allows them to be worn with almost any 
            tank top, t-shirt, or blouse.<br><br>

            It's critical to choose a pair of short shorts that aren't too small. You don't want them pressing your 
            thighs uncomfortably. Choose a pair of short shorts with cuffed hems rather than frayed hems for a more 
            refined look.<br><br>

        </p> <br>
        
        <h2>High-Waisted Shorts</h2> <br>
        <p>
            High-waisted shorts were popular in the 1970s and have since been reintroduced. High-rise shorts are all the 
            rage right now—you'll see them in every store—but you may not always know how to wear them without appearing 
            like an old lady.<br><br>

            Couple your high-waisted shorts and a stylish crop top for a fun beach day in Barbados. Wear a blouse and 
            tuck it into the high-rise shorts while out on the town. High-waisted shorts are flattering on any body type 
            because they reach your belly button.<br><br>
        </p> <br>

        <h2>Fashion Shorts</h2> <br>
        <p>
            There are many different fashion shorts in the fashion market; some are printed, some are solid colors, and 
            some are even made of lace. With so much variety, it's difficult to decide which style to try. Fashion shorts 
            are typically made of cotton and have an elastic or drawstring waist, making them extremely comfortable.<br><br>

            Wear a pair of high-rise fashion shorts for a classic look. The high-rise style lets you tuck your shirt in 
            for a more seamless appearance. If your shorts have patterns, pair them with a solid-colored shirt.<br><br>
        </p> <br>

        <h2>Midi Shorts</h2> <br>
        <p>
            Midi shorts fall to the middle of the thigh. These denim shorts are usually form-fitting, providing a good 
            compromise between short shorts and Bermuda shorts.<br><br>

            Midi-shorts are available in both high and low-rise styles—the choice is entirely yours. Many midi shorts 
            are available in denim, letting you pair them with almost any top. Dress it down with a loose white tee or up 
            with a slightly tucked-in blouse.<br><br>
        </p> <br>

        <h2>Cargo Shorts</h2> <br>
        <p>
            Cargo shorts aren't only for men! Ladies can wear them in both tomboy and girly outfits. They resemble cargo 
            shorts for men, but they are sometimes shorter and are typically found in army green or tan.<br><br>

            Pair your baggy, long cargo shorts and a form-fitting tank top for a more edgy look. Shorter and longer cargo 
            shorts look great with a tube top or tucked-in solid-colored t-shirt.<br><br>
        </p> <br>

        <h2>Leather Shorts</h2> <br>
        <p>
            Nothing quite captures the effortless, summer-ready “cool girl” look like a pair of black leather shorts. 
            While they aren't the most practical choice for the sweltering city heat, there's no denying that they'll add 
            intrigue and a tough edge to any outfit.Choose a high-waisted pair with a loose-fit cut around your legs and 
            a fitted, flattering waistband—a breeze in hot weather.
