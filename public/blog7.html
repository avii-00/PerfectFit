            Everybody loves fashion; we all love to wear fun outfits and glamorous accessories because it helps us show 
            our individuality and mood.

        </p> 

        <p>
            Feel like shopping for new clothes? When choosing your clothes, do you ever consider the impact of the 
            materials you wear? Not just to the economy but to the environment as well. Although most people are just 
            after the style of the clothes to add to their wardrobe, they've affected the lives of the farmers, factory 
            workers, and the environment before they get in there. According to the Fair Fashion Center (2016), the 
            global apparel industry affects 150 million lives. Most of them work in terrible conditions and don't even 
            get paid properly.<br><br>

            As consumers, we have so much power. By just being careful with the products we buy, we can help change the 
            world. If you are aware of the impact and want to reduce it, consider switching to organic fashion. 

        </p> <br><br>

        <h2>What is Organic Fashion?</h2> <br>
        <p>
            Organic clothes are all-natural organic clothing which safe for you and the environment. Crops are cultivated 
            according to the guidelines of organic farming. They are usually made from cotton, but they can also be made 
            from other materials such as flax, hemp, and wool.<br><br>

            Fibers used for organic fashion come from animals or crops grown or raised on organic farms. The way the 
            animals and crops are farmed makes a big difference to their environmental impact.<br><br>

            Organic farming is ethical and ensures that animal welfare is protected. As for the crops, organic farmers 
            use natural methods to grow them while building healthy soils and helping combat climate change. Organic 
            farming never uses genetically modified seeds, hazardous synthetic pesticides, or other chemical yielding 
            aids, meaning farmers' health is not at risk. Doing so positively affects the environment, agriculture, and 
            the health of planters worldwide.<br><br>
        </p> <br>
        
        <h2>Sustainable Fashion</h2> <br>
        <p>
            Organic fashion is a sustainable choice; however, seeing the word 'sustainable' on a label does not mean it's 
            organic. Although sustainable fashion is made in a way that protects and preserves the environment for future 
            generations, they are not organic.<br><br>

            For low or neutral greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable fabrics are created in a factory using renewable 
            energy and resources like wind, solar, geothermal, or hydropower.<br><br>

            The sustainable fabrics are polyester made from nylon made from old nets, recycled water bottles, 
            vegetable-tanned leather, and linen. It may be dyed, but in a factory that carefully treats its wastewater.
            <br><br>
            Sustainable fashion is made of high-quality materials and designed to last for years, so you don't have to 
            keep buying more frequently.<br><br>

            Many fashion brands are also switching to organic cotton, which uses 91% less water than non-organic cotton, 
            and growing it using sustainable farming practices. There are also brands using deadstock fabrics, recycled 
            fabrics, and more natural materials.<br><br>

            To be sure that you are buying genuinely organic clothes, look for one of the organic certification logos.
        </p> <br>

        <h2>Organic Logos to Look For</h2> <br>
        <p>
            Many fashion and textile retailers believe in letting their customers know how their clothes are made; sadly, 
            many brands hide the truth about their production and working conditions.<br><br>

            Some retailers label items as organic even if they know that they are not organic. Organic certification is 
            proof that their claims are backed up. It is essential to check the label when buying clothing or textiles to 
            ensure that what you are buying is genuinely as good as it looks. <br><br>
