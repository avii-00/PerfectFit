            Colombo Fashion Week is a developmental project that aims to drive progressive change in every aspect of the 
            fashion industry in Sri Lanka. Colombo Fashion Week's mission is to establish, develop and maintain an 
            efficient fashion eco-system that incubates the best of Sri Lankan fashion design before it is presented to 
            the world.
        </p> 

        <h2>The development of fashion is at the core of CFW Holdings</h2> <br>
        <p>
            The various companies of CFW focus on different aspects of fashion, from fashion week platforms, creative 
            events, media, sustainable fashion, education-based programs, and fashion brands. The key direction of CFW 
            is to create globally relevant solutions through products that impact the industry in a way that its 
            development has a positive impact on the environment and society. This is the basis of everything CFW does.
            <br><br>
            In 2020, CFW embarked on a first-of-its-kind program, Responsibility in Fashion and introduced a scoring 
            system, the Responsible Meter, where each garment presented carries a score measuring how accountable and 
            transparent it is. This is an unprecedented move to encourage both designers & consumers to be more aware of 
            the fashion industry's negative impact on the environment and to take measurable steps towards leaving a 
            positive mark on our planet.
        </p> <br>

            Colombo Fashion Week (CFW) is a developmental project that aims to drive progressive change in every aspect 
            of the fashion industry in Sri Lanka. A movement that started in 2003, Colombo Fashion Week has, in a 
            systematic manner, created formats that demand transformation across the key pillars that would define a 
            fashion industry. Colombo Fashion Week's mission is to establish, develop and maintain an efficient fashion 
            eco-system that incubates the best of Sri Lankan fashion design before it is presented to the world.<br><br>

            Colombo Fashion Week focuses on designer development while training and equipping designers with the know-how 
            on all aspects of the fashion industry, from fabric and textile development, to honing craft and technique, 
            input on intellectual properties, retail programs, guidance on branding, marketing and public relations for 
            the local and international markets. Over 85% of Sri Lankan designers are the product of this developmental 
            system. The platform also has a Fashion Design Fund in order to make resources available to high-potential 
            emerging designers. Every aspect that contributes to what is known as a progressive fashion industry is 
            carefully evaluated, so that every part plays a specific role like a well-oiled machine. Colombo Fashion Week 
            carries a mantle and a responsibility towards Sri Lanka's fashion design industry as the voice of fashion in 
            Sri Lanka and has come to be known as the backbone of the industry.
