            The fashion industry is among the most iconic industries in the world. There is always an emergence of 
            new trends and new fabrics in the clothing industry. But the key to success is always in quality, 
            perfection, and setting trends. Today, there are many different brands when it comes to fashion items. 
            Each of us has our own favorite clothing, bag, and shoe brand that we depend on to make us look stylish. 
            Many of us also dream of owning expensive luxury fashion items. 
        </p> 

        <p>
            Of the hundreds or thousands of fashion brands in the world, there are the most iconic and successful ones 
            that have stood the test of time. This means that these brands have been in the industry for many years and 
            are still very popular today. If you want to learn more about these brands, you're in the right place. In 
            this post, we are giving you an infographic on the major fashion brands. 
        </p> <br><br>

        <h2>Louis Vuitton</h2> <br>
        <p>
            Louis Vuitton is the second oldest fashion brand in the world that is still operating today. With this, it 
            is no surprise that it has been one of the most valuable luxury fashion brands worldwide for decades. It has 
            been such a huge part of the high-fashion world for a long time that it's easy to forget that Vuitton, who 
            was born in 1821 and founded the brand in 1854, was an actual person. <br><br>


            The founder of the brand was born in France. However, he was not born into luxury. In fact, his family had 
            working-class origins. Louis 's father was a farmer, and his mother was a milliner. After his mother 
            died and his father's following remarriage to a woman he did not get along with, he left their home in 1835.
            He was just a teenager back then. He spent two years walking from the small town of Anchay to Paris, getting
            into odd jobs and seeking temporary shelter along the way.<br><br>

            Louis Vuitton was 16 years old when he arrived in Paris. There, he became an apprentice to Monsieur Marechal, 
            a craftsman who specialized in making luggage boxes used to be carried on horse-drawn carriages, trains, and 
            boats. In that job, he learned craftsmanship by working with Marechal for 17 years before he left to begin 
            his own workshop for his luggage creations. <br><br>

            In 1858, he designed his first branded steamer trunk, which was waterproof, flat, and easy to stack. 
            Surprisingly, his original designs did not have the popular LV monogram. Instead, they were covered with 
            durable gray canvas called Trianon. In 1876, he introduced a striped canvas pattern for his luggage. Then, 
            after 12 years, he came out with the Damier print, which is the classic checkerboard pattern that the brand 
            still uses today. These patterns were made to prevent counterfeiting, which was already a thing before the 
            Louis Vuitton monogram was even made. <br><br>

            Did you know that Louis Vuitton did not design handbags or clothing? He only designed elegant cases that were 
            meant to hold and protect fashion items. Handbags did not become part of the brand until the decades after 
            his death, and clothing items came much later. Marc Jacobs became the creative director of Louis Vuitton in 
            1997. That was the time when he came up with the brand's first ready-to-wear clothing line. <br>

            Today, Louis Vuitton remains one of the most popular fashion brands in the world, and it is unlikely to 
            change any time soon.

        <h2>Gucci</h2> <br>
        <p>
            Gucci is an Italian fashion brand that was founded in 1921 by Guccio Gucci. It is among the oldest Italian 
            fashion brands that are still operating today. Similar to many historic fashion houses, Gucci also started as 
            a luggage manufacturer, making luxury travel goods for the upper classes in Italy, as well as equestrian 
            equipment. <br><br>

            Originally, the brand produced leather goods and premium knitwear, shoes, handbags, and silk goods. During 
            World War II, material constraints owing to the war effort forced Gucci to use cotton in manufacturing their 
            products. It was during this time that the brand introduced its popular “Double-G” monogram and the iconic 
            Gucci stripe that has two green stripes interrupted by a red bar.<br><br>

            Since the 1950s, Gucci has experienced great success as a brand of choice among wealthy travelers, Hollywood 
            stars, and other rich shoppers. It was well-known for its extravagant and lavish designs. In 1953, Guccio 
            Gucci passed away, but the business continued under the management of his three sons, Aldo, Vasco, and Rodolfo.
            The Gucci brand introduced luxury accessories like watches, eyewear, and jewelry to their product line in the 
            mid-60s. These items, later on, became a cornerstone of the brand. <br><br>

            Over the years, Gucci has developed as a symbol of abundance. It represents not only the luxury fashion house 
            but also a form of slang. Its most common argot usage is to describe something that is “doing well.” This can 
            be seen in songs by different popular singers and rappers, including Kanye West and Cardi B. At the present 
            time, Gucci is owned by Kering, a French luxury group that is also the owner of Yves Saint Laurent, Alexander 
            McQueen, and Balenciaga.
        </p> <br>

        <h2>Prada</h2> <br>
        <p>
            In 1913, Prada was founded in Milan by Mario Prada as a luxury leather goods firm. However, it made little 
            impact on the fashion industry until after Miuccia Prada took charge of her grandfather's company in 1978. 
            The first big success of the brand was the launch of a black nylon backpack with a triangular silver label. 
            Later on, her shoe and handbag designs became the center of a genuine cult of fashionable consumers in Europe,
            Japan, and America. <br><br>

            In 1989, a ready-to-wear line was added to the brand, and inaugurated the younger, less expensive Miu Miu 
            line in 1992, which was followed by Prada Sport. In addition, Prada also engaged in a series of complex 
            ownership moves in the late 1990s. It bought and sold stakes in Gucci, Fendi, and other companies. It also 
            formed a partnership with Azzedine Alaia in 2000.<br><br>

            The clothes and accessories offered by Prada have been described as classic and eccentric, plain but 
            fashionable. On the other hand, its style is modern, which draws on northern Italian traditions of subtle 
            elegance and good craftsmanship. The eccentricity of the fashion items by Prada appeals to artists and 
            intellectuals, while fashion editors are drawn to the brand's constant experimentalism. <br><br>
        </p> <br>

        <h2>Giorgio Armani</h2> <br>
        <p>
            Giorgio Armani, commonly known as Armani, is an Italian luxury fashion brand that was founded by Giorgio 
            Armani. It designs, manufactures, distributes, and retails ready-to-wear, leather goods, shoes, haute couture,
            watches, accessories, jewelry, and eyewear. It is the second-biggest fashion group in Italy, next to Prada. 
            The brand maintains the aura of a real luxury brand. In addition to becoming one of the most respected and 
            known brand names in the fashion industry, it is also among the most highly valued fashion companies 
            worldwide.<br><br>

            Armani was born in 1934 in the northern Italian town of Piacenza. He attended medical school at Piacenza 
            University for two years before he left for military service. While he was on leave from the military, he got 
            a job as a window dresser at a Milan department store in La Rinascente. He worked there up to a buyer position,
            which marked his first foray into fashion. He began working as a designer in 1965 at fashion house Nino Cerruti 
            where he met Sergio Galeotti. They started the company together in 1975. <br><br>

            Since Armani was a designer himself, he made apparel with his sense of aesthetics, luxury, and beauty, which 
            appealed to the elite of the society. It started as a privately held company with the founder Giorgio Armani 
            being the sole shareholder. The brand has become one of the strongest fashion luxury brands in the world, 
            with many sub-brands designed under the parent umbrella brand of Giorgio Armani to cater to the specific 
            needs of different market segments. <br><br>

            Giorgio Armani is a brand that is built on three pillars which are class, quality, and exclusivity. It covers 
            all corners of fashion, such as apparel, accessories, swimming, bags, shoes, watches, eyewear, and more. 
            Today, it is still one of the most successful fashion brands in the world.   <br>
        </p> <br>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2> <br>
        <p>
            These are the major fashion brands that are very popular around the world. In addition to these brands, there 
            are many more out there that are admired by fashion enthusiasts from different countries. But the ones we've 
            included here are the ones that made a huge impact in the world of fashion. These brands are mostly the 
            inspirations of many newer fashion brands today. It's amazing to know that the biggest luxury fashion brands 
            that we know today all had their humble beginnings before they became successful and iconic. We hope this 
            post helped you learn more about the major fashion brands. <br>
