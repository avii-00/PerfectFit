            Summer images include a long road trip, a day at the pool or beach, an elegant evening under the stars, a 
            garden tea party, and a riverboat trip. And boater hats are undeniably cheerful and ideal for sunny days.
        </p> 

        <p>
            Furthermore, you can convey your sense of style in any way you want for all these events, and wear an 
            amazing boater hat to top off your outfit. It will make you look glamorous even if you are casually 
            dressed and going into town to run errands.
            <br><br>

        </p> <br><br>

        <h2>What Is a Boater Hat?</h2> <br>
        <p>
            A boater hat, also known as a basher hat, cady hat, skimmer hat, somer hat, Katie hat, or sennit hat, is a 
            type of hat initially associated with boating and sailing. It is usually made of sennit straw and has a soft 
            or stiff brim, a flat crown, and a ribbon around the crown in the colors of a rowing crew, school, or other 
            institution.<br><br>

            Boaters were famous as summer hats in the late 1800s and early 1900s and were reportedly worn as unofficial 
            uniforms by FBI agents during the pre-war years. Today, they are only seen at sailing and rowing events, 
            musical and period theatrical performances, such as barbershop music, or as part of an old-fashioned school 
            uniform, like at Harrow School. Americans sometimes use inexpensive plastic or foam skimmers at political 
            rallies. <br><br>

            The boater is still a widely accepted part of the school uniform in many boys' schools in New Zealand, 
            Australia, and South Africa. The Madeira Carreiros drive the traditional wicker toboggans that transport 
            guests from the parish church at Monte down to Funchal center, where you can find Boaters.<br><br>

            The boater is a relatively formal hat, comparable in formality to the Homburg. Therefore, wearing a blazer 
            or in the same circumstances as a Homburg, such as a black-tie or smart lounge suit, is appropriate.
        </p> <br>
        
        
        <h2>Styles and Materials</h2> <br>
        <p>
            Originally, the boater hat was made entirely of woven straw. However, it can also be made of more fashionable 
            materials like raffia, lace, or canvas.<br><br>

            Choose the classic straw version for a laid-back or romantic look; pair it with floral prints, short dresses, 
            and flat sandals. Choose a delicate lace version for a more preppy look; you could even try colored raffia. 
            Choose leather, high heels, and clean-cut pieces for these styles.
        </p> <br>

        <h2>How to Wear a Boater Hat</h2> <br>
        <p>
            Boater hats are best reserved for bright days. Wear it a little tilted to one side or the other. This gives 
            it a more contemporary feel.<br><br>

            When it comes to your hair, the boater hat looks great with short hair or an up-do. Consider a low ballerina 
            bun for the strict-chic look or a slightly messy look for a more casual look. The boater hat also looks great 
            with a cute braid over one shoulder.
