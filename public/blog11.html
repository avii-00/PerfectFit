            Floral prints are among the trends that have been popular for years, just like stripes! It can be timeless and 
            feminine and is a summer wardrobe staple for most people. They come in a huge array of variations and colors 
            that you will never tire of.
        </p> 

        <p>
            If you're looking for new clothes, floral printed ones might be good. They are, however, difficult to style 
            and pull off. It can be a difficult task for those having difficulty incorporating them into an outfit.
            Continue reading to learn how to wear and style floral prints for any occasion.
            <br><br>

        </p> <br><br>

        <h2>When in Doubt, Remain Neutral</h2> <br>
        <p>
            It's nearly impossible for a floral print to look bad when paired with a solid neutral color. When you don't 
            have to wear many colors, such as those found in the actual print, neutrals such as white, black, ivory, 
            grey, and beige are another styling option. It's also a “safe” styling technique when you're unsure what to 
            wear but want to incorporate florals into your wardrobe.
        </p> <br>
        
        <h2>Maintain Unpredictability</h2> <br>
        <p>
            If you think florals are too girly or matronly for you, it's time to toughen them up by giving them a modern 
            edge. Over your skirt or dress, throw on a denim trucker jacket or a leather biker jacket. Alternatively, 
            pair a sharply tailored jacket with floral silk pants.<br><br>

            When paired with floral prints, the mix of feminine and masculine is incredibly alluring. Alternatively, go 
            short and pair with strappy gladiator sandals or sexy heels.<br><br>
        </p> <br>

        <h2>Remember Your Accessories</h2> <br>
        <p>
            It's always useful to have a floral accessory in your wardrobe, even if it adds a whimsy touch. But don't go 
            overboard. Remember to keep it simple, as with any statement-making outfit.<br><br>

            If you're wearing eye-catching prints, keep the accessories simple and let the print speak for itself. Choose 
            a chunky bracelet or cuff, one stunning pair of earrings, or a statement necklace—never all three— and avoid 
            small, dainty jewelry, which the busy florals will swallow up. On the other hand, scarves, bags, and hats can 
            add a splash of color.<br><br>
        </p> <br>

        <h2>Floral Prints: How to Wear Them for Any Occasion</h2> <br>
        <p>
            For a Romantic Evening<br><br>
            Get a floral-printed wrap top and a chiffon blouse! These lovely blouses will make you appear romantic and 
            feminine on your date. You can pull off this look by wearing it with neutral-colored heels and distressed 
            skinny jeans.<br><br>

            At the Workplace <br><br>
            Put on a pair of floral-printed wide-leg pants! It is possible to be both fashionable and comfortable. If 
            you're wearing floral pants, pair them with neutrals.<br>
            Neutral colors like beige, taupe, ivory, and grey serve as excellent foundations for putting together an 
            outfit. Make it perfect with a pair of floral pants on the bottom and a loose button-up shirt on top.<br><br>

            Go Casual<br><br>

            paired with a mini floral printed skirt will incorporate energy and freshness to your overall look, making it

            without sacrificing formality. You can add a fun twist to the overall look by wearing blue jeans and a white 
            shirt. Don't forget to accessorize with some minimalistic gold jewelry to complete the look.<br><br>
